         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156066:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 41 -->miles came in, to expreſſe their faithfull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the ſaid Earle, proffering their ſervice for his ſecurity, which was with thanks graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accepted, the Earle bearing himſelfe ſo nobly, and affable to all, that even thoſe that burne with malice againſt him inwardly, are won to expreſſe an outward love, and to extoll his actions.</p>
            <p>Having taken that nights repoſe, on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row came in all the well affected Gentry and Commonalty of that County, who in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent order (their Horſes being rallied in the manner of a Troop, five abreaſt) waited the comming forth of his Excellence, who had that morning appointed all thoſe Commanders that were in that part of the County, to attend his directions.</p>
            <p>His Excellence being mounted, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his quarters, was by a Gentleman preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a ſtately horſe, cole black, a rich ſaddle, embroydered with black, and gold, with a rich paire of piſtols. Likewiſe three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen preſented a ſchedule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was contained the joynt and reall reſolution of all the well-affected Gentry &amp; Commonalty of that County, wherein they proteſted to joyn with his Excellence in any ſervice hee ſhould pleaſe to command them, promiſing that their lives and eſtates ſhould reſt to bee commanded by him for the ſervice of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:156066:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 41 -->
Likewiſe declaring the innumerable oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they had ſuffered by the Cavaliers, who daily pillage mens houſes, drive away their cattail, take away their Armes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, cut and ſpoile their goods, taking away all meanes of living and ſubſiſting; all their endeavours tending to the deſtruſtion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: King, and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe (they ſeeing the authors of ſuch horrid miſchiefes, protected by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who ſhould preſerve them from ſuch outrages and puniſh the Authors) they hold themſelves bound both in conſcience to God, in loyaltie to His Majeſty, and in obedience to the Parliament, to uſe their utmoſt force to ſuppreſſe and utterly to extinguiſh and bring to confuſion, all thoſe that for the maintenance of their own develiſh deſigne, ſeek the ruine both of King and Kingdome: In which ſervice they were reſolved to live and dye with His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and his Excellence with large expreſſions of joy returned them thanks; promiſing that all his endeavours ſhould by Gods protection and bleſſing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their expectation, withall encouraging them to continue conſtant in their Reſolution, the King and Kingdom lying now at the ſtake, and Religion running an equall hazard.</p>
            <p>Afterwards his Excellence repaired into the field attended by his owne Troop, the trained
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156066:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 42 -->bands, and all the Gentry and Comminalty of the Countie, where hee gave directions what ſhould be done for the furtherance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſervice: Alſo he tooke order that thoſe foore companies that were bilited in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiere, Buckinghamſhire, Bedfordſhire, Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and other adjoyning Counties; ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vahce neerer to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> ſo that his Forces might bee knit and united into a compleate body.</p>
            <p>Since the arrivall of His Excellence, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers begin to hide their heads, and to keepe cloſe, ſo that the Countries are free from pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging now.</p>
            <p>It is reported that ſince the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> came ſo naere <hi>Nrttingham,</hi> that the King is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly gone to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> but I queſtion the truth of it, it being no way probable.</p>
            <p>The King is in great want of money, for a letter came from one of his ſervants, wherein was declared that his Majeſty weyes his plate by the ounces, and gives his ſouldiers for their pay, being in great want of money, and that ſince the beginning of this war, His Majeſty hath not paid his Servants their board-wages, by which meanes many of them are ſo neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated that they wouldcome home, if they could get ſo much money as would beare their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> having been at <hi>Yorke,</hi>
